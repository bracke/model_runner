--  Matrix-vector products on a device.
--
--  One operation, because one is what an evaluation is made of: a matrix of
--  rows by columns against a vector of columns, giving a vector of rows.
--  Everything else the engine does is that, repeated.
--
--  An Engine holds what is expensive to make -- the pipeline, the layout,
--  the command pool -- and makes what is cheap per call. Buffers are cheap
--  and are made per call in this piece; keeping a model resident on the
--  device is what the piece after this one is for, and it is the difference
--  between a device that helps and one that spends its time being handed
--  the same weights again.
--
--  Availability. Everything here reports failure rather than raising. A
--  machine with no device, a driver that refuses, a shader that will not
--  load: each is a False, and the caller runs on the processor instead.
--
--  Arithmetic. The shader accumulates in binary32 where the processor's
--  kernels accumulate a row in binary64 and round once. The two agree to
--  the precision binary32 carries and not beyond it, which is a thing to
--  measure rather than to assume.
--
--  Task safety: an Engine belongs to one task. Two tasks wanting a device
--  want two engines.
